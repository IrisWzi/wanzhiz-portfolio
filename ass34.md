# Original data visualization

The original data visualization was taken from the 2008 BBC article [Minorities set to be US majority](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7559996.stm>). It talks about how the minority population in the US is projected to become the majority by 2042. I chose this visualization because of my interests in the demographic change in the US, and also because I initially thought it is a nice visulaization work, but changed my mind on second thought. I realized things about this particular visualization that are counter-intuitive and could be improved.
