# Critique by Design

## Original data visualization

The original data visualization was taken from the 2008 BBC article [Minorities set to be US majority](<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7559996.stm>). It talks about how the minority population in the US is projected to become the majority by 2042. I chose this visualization because of my interests in the demographic change in the US, and also because I initially thought it is a nice visulaization work, but changed my mind on second thought. I realized things about this particular visualization that are counter-intuitive and could be improved. 

## Developing process

When I first looked at the chart, my attention was immediately drawn to the bottom blue part which represents declining white population. It took me another second to realize it also shows that the minority population is growing, which should be the main idea of this chart. The bar chart and the colors shows the percentage changes over the time, but it is somewhat difficult to compare the size of the shapes when the changes are small. And because there are so many values on the chart, I found myself looking the numbers instead of comparing the bars. If I am to redesign the chart, I would flip the chart upside down and color the white population gray since it is not the focus of this chart. I also would not put so many numbers on the chart. Since it is merely a projection, the numbers do not matter that much. The audience should focus more on the trend of population change. In this case, a line chart may be more suitable to show the trend. 

This is my first sketch. I made three major changes to the original chart. First, I put the white population on the top and only colored the minority groups so that the audience will focus on the growing minorities. Second, I added lines on top of the bars so show the trend over time. Third, I changes the title of the chart to emphasize the idea behind this visualiation.

I showed my sktech to my friends and they gave me some valuable feedbacks. They agreed that my wireframe is an improvemnet compared to the origin design because the trend was more obvious. But some of them also said that althrough I removed the values, the lines and bars seems a bit redundant together.They suggested I could make the chart simpler. 

I reflected on their suggestions and agreed that the bars seemed unnecessary since the lines can show both values and the trend. So I decided to switch to area chart and updated my sketch.

## Final data visualization
This is my final redesign.
