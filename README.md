Portfolio for CMU 94-870 Telling Stories with Data 

# About me
Hi there! I am Wanzhi Zhang (She/Her/Her) and I am currently an MRSD (Master of Robotic Systems Development) student at CMU. This is my final year and I am graduating in May. My interests lie in robot perception and SLAM. Most of my past experiences are related to robotics, and in particular, autonomous vehicles.

# What I hope to learn
I am compeletely new to the field of design and data visualization, but I have always enjoyed seeing informative and esthetic data visualizations works. By taking this course, I hope to learn to use data visualization to convey information in an efffective way, and to know how to use various data visualization tools. From what I learn in this course, I want to have a additional 'designer perspective' in my future career as an engineer.
