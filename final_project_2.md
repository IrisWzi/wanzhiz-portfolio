## User Research and Interviews

### Target Audience

My target audience are the general public living in the US who are under the impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. More specificly, those who are aware of the physcial health crisis brought by COVID-19, but may not notice the its impact on mental health.

I interviewed three of my friends and classmates and tried to be as diverse as possible with respect to their gender and backgrounds.

### Interview Script
Data Visualization: Are the charts clear and easy to understand?

Story Flow: Is the current story structure logical?

Biggest Problem: What would you change about the current design?

Improvement: What additional information would you add?

### Key Findings
- Improvements could be made on some of the text colors and font size
- Some were confused about what exactly are 'essential workers' and 'trained professionals'
- The most impressive part are the charts about different groups because of the contrast
- The last section needs more developemnt. Feels a bit weak now.
- Call to action could be more specific and clear

### Planned Changes
- Adjust the text color and font size of the first bar chart
- Add explanatory text to the data and concepts
- Develop the last section
