## Data

One of the main data sources would be [US Censor Bureau Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey/data.html), which reflects how people's lives have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

There's also [Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm) by CDC.

Some of the data will come from the following reports: [2021 State of Mental Health in America](https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/2021%20State%20of%20Mental%20Health%20in%20America_0.pdf) by Mental Health America, [Porjected Deaths of Despaie from COVID-19](https://wellbeingtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WBT_Deaths-of-Despair_COVID-19-FINAL-FINAL.pdf) by Well Being Trust, [The Implications of COVID-19 for Mental Health and Substance Use](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/) by Kaiser Family Foundation.

## Method and medium

I will first try to collect data related to this topic and work on initial sketches to present the data. I will then develop the stories I want to tell and compelete the wireframe, possibly with Balsamiq. User research will be conducted to make sure the story and the presentation are clear and convincing. The final data visulization will use Flourish, Infogram, and Tableau. I will use Shorthead to present this project.
