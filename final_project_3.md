### Changes Made

Based on the feedbacks I collected from Part 2 and the group critique in class, I made the following changes:

- Added the section of Call To Action, provided links and resources
- Changed the color of the labels in the first bar chart to a darker color
- Changed the color of the last bar chart to avoid confusion
- Deleted the map graph of "NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS" and added text

### Design

I initially chose this topic because I was curious how the pandemic, the isolation, the "new norm" has affected people mentally as we are one year in the pandemic. I did some research and was suprised to find that so more people are suffering from all kinds of mental illness since COVID. The intention of this project is to raise the awareness of caring for each other's mental health and the target audience is the general public living in the US. With that in mind, I tried to make the story straightforward and catchy so that audience from diverse backgrounds can all get the message and not lose interest.

The first slide tries to attract the audience by dropping the suprising fact that people experiencing anxiety and depression is four times compared to pre-COVID. The second slide shows the percentage of people experiencing specific symptoms. Hopefully the audience will feel related by identifying similar symptoms on themselves or people around them. The third part is an infographic showing the more vulnerable groups. The data are similar and I decided it was best to use bar charts. But it was too dull to use the same bar chart for six times, so I tried to switch between bar charts and column charts. Then I listed some exisitng and coming problem. I did not find much data on these problems so I did not do any data visualization in this part and kept it concise. In the final call to action part, I listed some suggestions as well as links to more resources.

I did not add too much text because the data speaks for itself, and it is pretty clear even without further explanation. I tried to keep the colors consistent. I used the Shorthand default format which is blue, so I tried to use blue as the main color for all my visulizations. The highlights are all in red. I also added many illustrations as backgrounds to make scrolling pages more interesting.
