# Assignment - Visualizing government debt
The following three charts show the government debt-to-GDP ratio of OECD countries.
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

## Bar Chart
This visualization shows the Debt-to-GDP roatio of 28 countries in 2018.

## Discussion
The first bar chart shows the ratio of different countries in the same year. It's clear comparision, but if I want to include data from previous years, the chart would be to complicated for so many countries. The grid of lines chart shows the trend of each country, but it is difficult to compare between countries. 
I choose the Beeswarm scatter plot for my visualization because of its ability to show how change of values over time using animation. I also want to show the difference between different regions because with so many countries, it would be more clear if the dots are grouped. I initially just grouped them by continents, then I realized there are too many dots within Europe, so I further divided them based on their region. The animation can demostrate how the dots were initially close to each other, how the debts grew after 2008, and how they scattered in recent years.
